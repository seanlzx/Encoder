## Ceaser Encoder and Decoder
This program was done as an assessment for a job application.

It was preferenced by the assessors, that OOP concepts be demonstrated in the program.

The reference table provided by the assessors did not provide lower-case characters, so I made the assumption that casing remains the same during the encoding and decoding process.

My code is way too ðŸ’© to be done by AI
